# Computational Approaches to Biological Questions

Similarity between (genetic) molecules can indicate homology between structure or function of multiple different species

## Molecular Biology's Central Dogma

> I have made almost a transcription of this section (of course, as possible in my own words) because of my academic and professional background not being very solid in Biology, and I have found this to be a remarkable learning exercise in this regard. 

DNA is a ilnear polymer made of nucleotides (A, G, C and T), and contains the information needed by living beings to replicate themselves. This information is processed by cells, where it can be **replicated**, **transcripted** into RNA, and where RNA is **translated** into protein.

The entire DNA sequence, called the *genome* is divided into different sections called *genes*, that can perform different functions:

 - Protein-coding: Create chemical machines that serve different functions in organisms: proteins
  - RNA specification: Create chemical machines with different component parts than proteins: RNA machines
  - Untranscribed: DNA that serves a function but is not directly transcribed or translated into a molecule.

### Replication

Two molecules of DNA form a double helix, and are twinned and attached by their nucleotides: an A can only be attached to a T, and a G to a C. This allows the replication of DNA by sepparating each mirrored complementary DNA strand.

### Transcription

RNA can exist in double helix or a single strand. RNA's nucleotides (A, C, G, and U - this last intead of T) still make pairs, so RNA is folded into 3D structures. The three main types of RNA molecules are: messenger, transfer and ribosomal.

 - **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**: Transcripts of genes, from the genome to the ribosome, where protein is synthesized.
  - **Transfer RNA**: This is RNA that is not translated and carries aminoacids to the ribosome so protein can be synthesized with them.
  - **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)**: This is unstranslated RNA made of building blocks of the ribosome (protein+RNA). It catalyzes the translation of mRNA into protein.
  
### Translation
  
 Proteins are made of aminoacids, and each aminoacid belongs to a alphabet that has 20 commonly known members. Unlike DNA, protein contain informationn but also functional molecules.
 
 Proteins have primaty, secondary and tertiary strcutures: the primary refers to he chemical sequence, and the rest to the way this sequence is folded and/or functionalized.

> **Molecular Evolution**:
Errors in replication and transcription in the reproductive cells of an organism are passed to its progeny; this is called a *mutation*. These mutations can be harmful, beneficial or neutral. The acumulation of mutations over generations is responsible for *evolution*.

## Using Models in Biology

Models are used to get simplify and understand systems that are very complicated to study. 

Even when modelling brings uncertainties, these can be justified due to the usefulness of the model, that may allow preliminary analysis of biological systems, without the need to invest laboratory resources in order to meet worthy conclusions. 

Some computational methods used are:

 - 1D representation of three-dimensional DNA molecules
 -  Prediction of structure of proteins based on previously obtain data about similar molecule's structure.
  - Modeling of chemical reactions
   - Sequence alignment
 - Sequence searching
 - Gene prediction
 - Extraction of patterns from sequence data
 - Protein sequence analysis
  - Protein structure prediction
  - Protein structure alignment and comparison
  - Biochemical simulation
  - Whole genome analysis.
  - Primer design
  - DNA microarray analysis
  - Proteomic analysis
  
## A computational Biology Experiment

As any other science, every study in computational biology must answer a hypothesis. Computational experiments may follow the next steps: 

### Identification of the Problem

A problem usually is described by a question we are going to answer with the results of our study, and this question must be established as a set of hypotheses. This problem an its hypotheses must be very well defined so the project we embark on has a reasonable time of execution in order to meet completion.

Next, I'm going to quote the set of questions we must answer in order to identify the problem. The bold text is put by me to highlight key words:

>  -  What is the **question** this project is trying to answer?
- What is the **final form** you expect the **results to take**? Is the goal to produce a computer program, a data set that will be used in an ongoing project, a journal publication, etc.? What are the **requirements for success** or completion of the project?
 - What is the approximate timeline of the project?
 - What is the general outline of the project? Here, it would be appropriate to break the project down into constituent parts and describe what you think needs to be done to finish each part.
 - How does your project fit in with the work of others? If you're a lone wolf, you don't have to worry about this, but research scientists tend to run in packs. It's good to have a clear understanding of where your work is dependent on others. If you are writing a project spec for a group of people to work on, indicate who is responsible for each part of the work.
- At what point will it be unprofitable to continue?
