# Non codifying RNA

Results are still very dependant on laboratory studies that have not been carried on.

Mother database: [gene bank][genebank]

its FTP holds genomes, proteoms, etc. We are looking if in this DB there is information about non-coding RNA.


Let's go to this FTP address:

```
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Homo_sapiens/mapview/
