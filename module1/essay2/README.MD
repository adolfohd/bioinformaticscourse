# Computational Approaches to Biological Questions

Similarity between (genetic) molecules can indicate homology between structure or function of multiple different species

## Molecular Biology's Central Dogma

> I have made almost a transcription of this section (of course, as possible in my own words) because of my academic and professional background not being very solid in Biology, and I have found this to be a remarkable learning exercise in this regard. 

DNA is a ilnear polymer made of nucleotides (A, G, C and T), and contains the information needed by living beings to replicate themselves. This information is processed by cells, where it can be **replicated**, **transcripted** into RNA, and where RNA is **translated** into protein.

The entire DNA sequence, called the *genome* is divided into different sections called *genes*, that can perform different functions:

 - Protein-coding: Create chemical machines that serve different functions in organisms: proteins
  - RNA specification: Create chemical machines with different component parts than proteins: RNA machines
  - Untranscribed: DNA that serves a function but is not directly transcribed or translated into a molecule.

### Replication

Two molecules of DNA form a double helix, and are twinned and attached by their nucleotides: an A can only be attached to a T, and a G to a C. This allows the replication of DNA by sepparating each mirrored complementary DNA strand.

### Transcription

RNA can exist in double helix or a single strand. RNA's nucleotides (A, C, G, and U - this last intead of T) still make pairs, so RNA is folded into 3D structures. The three main types of RNA molecules are: messenger, transfer and ribosomal.

 - **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**: Transcripts of genes, from the genome to the ribosome, where protein is synthesized.
  - **Transfer RNA**: This is RNA that is not translated and carries aminoacids to the ribosome so protein can be synthesized with them.
  - **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)**: This is unstranslated RNA made of building blocks of the ribosome (protein+RNA). It catalyzes the translation of mRNA into protein.
  
### Translation
  
 Proteins are made of aminoacids, and each aminoacid belongs to a alphabet that has 20 commonly known members. Unlike DNA, protein contain informationn but also functional molecules.
 
 Proteins have primaty, secondary and tertiary strcutures: the primary refers to he chemical sequence, and the rest to the way this sequence is folded and/or functionalized.

> **Molecular Evolution**:
Errors in replication and transcription in the reproductive cells of an organism are passed to its progeny; this is called a *mutation*. These mutations can be harmful, beneficial or neutral. The acumulation of mutations over generations is responsible for *evolution*.
